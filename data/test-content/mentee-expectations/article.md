## Mentee levels

### Beginner
Definition

* Just starting out in your learning journey.
* Limited or no prior experience.
* Focused on foundational skills and understanding basic concepts.

Goals

* Build a solid understanding of fundamental concepts. This includes:
    * Basic syntax of your chosen language
    * Breaking down a problem into small pieces
    * Being able to trace what is happening in code, line by line
    * Develop good study and work habits.  

Here are some habits that can help you succeed in getting a job as a software engineer (and in life more generally):

* Make a schedule. This is probably the most important task you can do. Outline which days you’ll be working on code-related things and the hours in which you’ll do so. Some people find it helpful to be even more detailed and outline what you’re going to learn and do each time frame.
* Set goals. Maybe you want to understand for loops. Maybe you want to be comfortable building and launching a website. Maybe you want to create a basic server and be able to send requests to it. Whatever it is, set a date where you want to get it done by and work to reach that goal!
* Build a team. Having people around you helps make you more accountable. The support that they can offer you can help you get unstuck and become aware of areas that you weren’t aware of.
* Immerse yourself. Follow engineers you come across on X, Mastodon, or whatever. Find and subscribe to some newsletters that you like. Follow some developer YouTube accounts.
* Feeling blocked? Ask for help. 
* Feeling burned out? Try learning about a different area of study. For example, if you’ve been solely focused on JavaScript, learn about CSS.
* Try to avoid having a victim mentality. We’re here to help you build the skills to be able to be successful and a victim mentality only gets in the way of that. Help us help you!
* Build your network. LinkedIn is the best tool right now. For more, see our tips for finding a job, this will be provided on your dashboard after onboarding
