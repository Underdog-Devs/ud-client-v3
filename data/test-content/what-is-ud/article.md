## UD mission doc
### What is UD 

We are a group of software engineers helping aspiring developers who are either formerly incarcerated or from an economically disadvantaged background. We are creating opportunities in tech for people who might not otherwise get an opportunity.

## How do we help those people

Underdog Devs strives to ensure that mentees receive comprehensive support tailored to their needs, whether they are looking for general guidance, focused learning, or industry-specific insights. 

### Community 

The community engagement is offered to all mentees who enter Underdog Devs. 

### Resources

Mentors and mentees contribute to building resource libraries that can be used to aid in learning for a vast variety of subject matter

### Slack Engagement

We have many channels where mentors and mentees discuss and collaborate on many industry related topics.  Mentees can ask questions and have confidence that mentors who are knowledgeable in that area will be able to answer them.  
We commonly see questions/discussions on the following topics:

* Resume reviews
* Where do I start
* Detailed language/tech stack questions
* Job readiness questions

### Town Halls 

Mentees and mentors can catch up on whats happening in the community.

## Mentor Hosted AMA’s (ask me anythings/Q&As)

People familiar with the industry give mentees the chance to join open meetings to ask about what's on their mind.  This can be a good opportunity to get to know folks and do some networking.

### Location Based Meetups

Underdog Dev members occasionally get together with others in their area.  For example our WWDC watch party in Orlando, FL, or our small meetup of NY & NJ members in Central Park.  
We encourage members to host these themselves.

## Mentorship

Mentors in the industry volunteer their time to meet with mentees to help them in various ways.

### Pods

Pod are small groups of up to three mentees, focusing on coding, soft skills, and interview preparation.

 ❗️ __Available to mentees who display they are active in the community__ 📝 What constitutes being active in the community

* Regular group sessions that teach coding concepts and best practices.
* Group discussions and collaborative learning.
* Mock interviews and feedback to help mentees prepare for job interviews.
* Mentees learn to improve their soft skills and professional readiness.

### Project Underdog

Project Underdog is our 3 month program for a select cohort of 
__formerly incarcerated mentees only__ selected through an application process. This covers their monthly expenses allowing them to commit to full time studying with the goal of becoming hired at the end. 

 ❗️ This is not to be confused with Underdog membership, everyone who joins slack joins as a regular member. Project Underdog is by application only when available

* Weekly one-on-one or group sessions.
* Guidance on coding projects, code review, and constructive feedback.
* Helps mentees develop soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and time management.
* Tracks mentee progress throughout.
* Mentees who are accepted into the program must dedicate 40 hours per week to full time studying

Note: Each Project Underdog mentee is assigned 3-5 mentors, each providing 1 hour per week for 8 weeks.
